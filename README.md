# WebApiCoreExample
ASP.NET Core WebApi example with Full Framework using LiteDB for CRUD.

This project was created to have an API in order to do the exercises from the book "The Majesty Of Vue.js". The authors only provide an API created with Laravel which I didn't want to install on my Windows machine :wink: ...

Visual Studio Community Edition and dotNet Framework 4.5.2 is the minimum requirement to get this project running at localhost port 5000. You don't even need IIS express.
